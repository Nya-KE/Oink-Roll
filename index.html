            <center><h3>Once upon a time, there were three pigs and a butcher.</h3>
              <p>Now, this butcher was a really good butcher. All the people in the town would enter his shop and after paying a fee would leave with bouncing bags and glee. As for the pigs who numbered up to three; they lived quite snug in a sty quite muddy, never dry. Though fate declared eldest piggy a sneaky little spy.<br><br>
              With a curious little eye, he would see the people happier than he. Oh he sighed, he could not never let that be.
              So he pried and he tried till he realised the butcher's part. Promise not to cry for a tragic end is nigh. <br><br>
              For eldest piggy stole away to the butcher's shop. In he went, looking for a key to joy but instead he found a sharpened toy. Chop, chop chop, was all we heard and the little piggy, he didn't come back.<br> At the moment two piggies remain, curious about the dissapearance of their kin. <br><br>

              Play a game for two to find out which pig shall undertake the fatal mission to the mysterious butcher's shop.</p>
